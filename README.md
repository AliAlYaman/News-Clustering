# News Clustering Analysis

My repository (News-Clustering) contains my solutions to the **AI Engineers Notebooks**, originally created (https://github.com/larawehbe/TheAIEngineers-Notebooks). These notebooks focus on various machine learning, data preprocessing, and clustering techniques. I have worked through the notebooks independently to enhance my understanding and skills in these areas.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization to represent text data.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA to visualize high-dimensional data.
- **Clustering Algorithms**:
  - K-Means
  - Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
  - Silhouette Analysis for evaluating clusters
- **Data Visualization**: Scatter plots and dendrograms for visualizing clustering results.

## Results
- The notebook showcases how clustering techniques can group news articles based on textual similarities.
- Visualization helps interpret and validate the clustering performance.
